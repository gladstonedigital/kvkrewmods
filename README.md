This fully configured curated modpack enhances gameplay while keeping the spirit true to the vanilla game.

We've got QoL tweaks, lots of suits, new items, and more!

There's a few fun surprises too...

Note: whenever mods are removed from the modpack, you should create a fresh profile with the mod manager and install just the modpack. Otherwise, the removed mods will remain in your configuration.

The modpack takes a sec to install with the mod manager, that's normal. Just give it a min.

Please report any issues or suggestions on the Github.
